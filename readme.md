# VSLABX (MPLABX Extension)

An extension that enables building and debugging MPLABX projects from within Visual Studio Code

## VSLABX Prerequisites

* MPLABX v5.40 or greater installed on machine
    * Older installations may work but are not validated

## Build

Building can be started by either using the command `MPLABX: Build Project` from the command pallet or creating setting up a build task in `.vscode/tasks.json`. For a build to be successful, several auto-generated files are needed. These files can be generated by opening the project in MPLABX, or by running the `MPLABX: Update private make files` command.

### MPLABX: Build Project
When called from the command pallet, this command will do the following:
* Scans the current workspace for MPLABX project folders by looking for a `Makefile` contained in a folder that end's with `.X`
    * If more then one MPLABX project folder is found, the user will be prompted to select one of the project folders found
* Invokes MPLABX's make with at the directory of the selected project

### Build Task
To create a build task:
* Create the `.vscode/task.json` file
    * Issue the `Tasks: Run Build Task` command from the command pallet, or by using the build keybinding "ctrl+b"
    * A "No build task configured..." message should appear. Press enter to create to select a task template.
    * Select "create task.json from task template"
    * Select "Others"
* Added the `mplabx`build configuration
    * Clear out the contents `tasks` object (from square bracket open to close)
    * Start typing `mplabx-build` and press enter to insert the following snippet
   ```
    {
        "label": "MPLABX Build",
        "type": "mplabx",
        "task": "build",
        "projectFolder": "${workspaceFolder}/\"Path to MPLABX Project\"",
        "configuration": "default",
        "problemMatcher": [
            {
                "base": "$xc",
                "fileLocation": [
                    "relative",
                    "${workspaceFolder}/\"Path to MPLABX Project\""
                ],
            }
        ],
        "group": {
            "kind": "build",
            "isDefault": true
        }
    }
    ```
    * If the MPLABX project is not the same as the `workspaceFolder` append the rest of the path to the `projectFolder` item e.g. `"${workspaceFolder}\TestProject.X"`
    * If building an MPASM project, replace the problem matcher with the following:
    ```
    "problemMatcher": [
                "$mpasm",
                "$mpasm-msg"
            ],
    ```
* Save the file
* Run the `Tasks: Run Build Task` command again
    * Press enter to select a build task
* Select "MPLABX Build"
* Now running the build command will build the selected project

## Program
TODO: Implement
## Debug

### Setup Debugging
Debugging is setup by adding the `MPLABX: Debug Launch` configuration to the launch.json file.

```
{
    "type": "mplabx",
    "request": "launch",
    "name": "MPLABX Debug",
    "program": "${workspaceFolder}/",
    "stopOnEntry": true,
    "preLaunchTask": "MPLABX Build"
}
```

If a launch.json file has not been created, one can be created by going to the debug tab in the side bar and clicking `create a launch.json file`, and selecting `MPLABX: Debug`.

All programer settings are pulled from the project file in `nbproject/configuration.xml`. This includes what tool to use and any voltage settings. If programer settings need to be changed, it is recommended to change them from withing MPLABX to prevent corrupting the project.

### Running Debugger
Use F5 or the run button on the debugger tab. The `preLaunchTask` item in the configuration will call the build task before connecting to the hwtool, programing, and starting. These tasks can take a while to execute.

### Debugger Notes
The names of programers do not match between the configuration file and the mdb tool. As such, the names of the tools need to matched up manually. If you would like to use a tool that is not listed below, please [submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/callwyat/mplab-extension/issues) with the name of the tool listed in `nbproject\configuration` e.g. (`<platformTool>pk4hybrid</platformTool>`)

### Supported Tools
A list of all supported tools can be found in [supportedTools.json](./src/debugAdapter/supportedToolsMap.json)

Basic simulator support is available, but support for stimulus files is missing currently. If you would like support for them, please [submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/callwyat/mplab-extension/issues)
